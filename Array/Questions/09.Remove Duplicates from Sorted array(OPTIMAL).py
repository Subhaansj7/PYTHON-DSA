#Intuition: We can think of using two pointers ‘i’ and ‘j’, we move ‘j’ till
#we don't get a number arr[j] which is different from arr[i].
#As we got a unique number we will increase the i pointer and update its value by arr[j]. 

#Approach:
#Take a variable i as 0;
#Use a for loop by using a variable ‘j’ from 1 to length of the array.
#If arr[j] != arr[i], increase ‘i’ and update arr[i] == arr[j].
#After completion of the loop return i+1, i.e size of the array of unique elements.
