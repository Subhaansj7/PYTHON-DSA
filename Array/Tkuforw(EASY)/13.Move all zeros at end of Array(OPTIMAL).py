#Algorithm:
#First, using a loop, we will place the pointer j. If we donâ€™t find any 0, we will not perform the following steps.
#After that, we will point i to index j+1 and start moving the pointer using a loop.
#While moving the pointer i, we will do the following:
#If a[i] != 0 i.e. a[i] is a non-zero element: We will swap a[i] and a[j]. 
#Now, the current j is pointing to the non-zero element a[i].
#So, we will shift the pointer j by 1 so that it can again point to the first zero.
#Finally, our array will be set in the right manner.
