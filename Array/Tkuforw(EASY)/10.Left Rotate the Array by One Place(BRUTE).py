#Intuition:
#The rotated array has just a difference that its first element is present at the last index of the array.
#So if we can just store the element at the first index and then shift all the elements towards the left 
#and at last put the stored element at the last index. We will get the rotated array.

#Approach:
#We can take another dummy array of the same length and then shift all elements in the array toward the left
#and then at the last element store the index of 0th index of the array and print it.
